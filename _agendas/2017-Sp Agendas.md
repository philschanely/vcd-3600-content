* [ ] Designing grid systems
    * Define constraints such as default canvas, brand restraints, and advertisements.
    * Sketch grid options given these constraints, asking at least how will you subdivide the canvas from side to side? Thirds? Fourths? Other? How many units does this imply?
    * Open a scratch file and begin setting type at various widths in these grid constraints and determine the baseline grid.
    * Use baseline grid as a base for determining how to create vertical rhythm.

* [ ] Introduction to WordPress and CMSs
    * Put content management in the hands of clients or at least non-developers
    * Most use server-based technology such as PHP/MySQL

    * As a result we shift even more towards thinking about page templates that set the stage for a range of content to fill them
    * Draw wireframe and discuss how the content is pulled from the page and instead loaded from DB.
