Spring semester is almost here and that means its time to start prepping classes. 

This term I'm implementing a few new technologies:

* InVision -- I've used InVision in my UX class for two years now but I'm excited to use it across the board for students to submit their design work for my review and for setting up prototypes of the interactivitiy.
* Sketch -- This new design tool is now available in our computer labs and I've decided its high time I start using it regularly. What convinced me to take the leap now is that InVision created an 8-part series teaching Sketch in small chunks. With this tool I could more easily see expecting students to pick up the tool easier.
* Codio -- I'm very excited to start using Codio for hosting exercises and projects. I'm hoping that this will give me greater access to my students' work, especially tracking their time on task and placing instructions near their work.
