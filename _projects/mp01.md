### Overview

This project is aimed to help you continue to improve your speed and proficiency with HTML/CSS skills as well as experiment with another specific genre of web design: a single-page (micro) site that is responsive for four different devices sizes from smartphone up to widescreen displays.

Choose a topic of interest that includes a variety of high quality images, features or highlights, and some narrative such as an innovative product, a cause, or an upcoming event. Your site should act as an advertisement or call to action for the topic such as "Buy now" for a product, "Take action" for a cause, or "Register" for an event.

See the provided wireframes. The site will use the following structure:

* First, it begins with a striking masthead that contains a full-bleed image, the topic and a tagline.
* Next will be an overview section that includes a short lead-in paragraph, several supporting paragraphs and an action button. This will also include another image on the larger three responsive stops.
* Third will be a set of four features or highlights on the topic. For example, this could be features of a product, key points or appeals of a cause, or highlights of an upcoming event. Each of these will contain a single image and brief supporting text.
* Fourth will be a larger narrative section that includes several robust paragraphs and at least one bulleted list.
* Finally, the footer will contain one more image, a final statement and action button and a copyright statement.

#### Requirements

* Build a single-page site using the deliverables below as a guide.
* Process and deliverables must make use of required tools including Sketch, Invision, and Codio.
* Final submission must include simple, semantic HTML and implement the CSS row-and-column theory covered in this class.

### Deliverable A: Design Comps

Use the provided wireframes to create your site concept at four different sizes:

**Smartphone (320px min)**
: A single-column layout with a full-bleed masthead but 20px minimum side margins through the rest of the layout.

**Tablet (768px min)**
: A multi-column layout with a full-bleed masthead but that otherwise occupies a centered 720px primary layout. Consider 12 60px columns subdividing this space and vertical blocks of 120px for vertical rhythm where practical.

**Desktop (1200px min)**
: A multi-column layout with a full-bleed masthead but that otherwise occupies a centered 1200px primary layout. Consider 12 100px columns subdividing this space and vertical blocks of 240px for vertical rhythm where practical.

**Desktop (1920px min up to 2560px)**
: A multicolumn layout with a full-bleed masthead but that otherwise occupies a centered 1920px primary layout. Consider 12 160px columns subdividing this space and vertical blocks of 480px for vertical rhythm where practical.

You must use Sketch to create your comps in a single document using separate art boards. Use this Layout and Grid features to establish your layout and grid. Finally, be sure to use fonts from the Google Fonts API.

To submit your deliverable:

* Create a Project in InVision named `Web2 MP1 [Lastname]`.
* Add the professor as a collaborator on this InVision project.
* Sync your art boards to this project from Sketch using the Craft plugin. 
* Submit MP1-A in Moodle to indicate you're ready for review.

### Deliverable B: Markup

Create the simplest, semantic markup you need in order to begin to build out your design using HTML and CSS. Follow this process:

1. *Layout Analysis:* Identify and label the rows and columns in your comp.
2. *File setup:* 
    1. Open the `MP1` starter project in Codio and in it create an `images` folder, `styles.css`, and `index.html`.
    2. Export any images you need from your comp using the slice/export options and upload them into your `images` folder in Codio.
4. *Content Markup:* Analyze the structure of the content in your comp and create the corresponding simple HTML content in your index.html file.
5. *Organizing/Layout Markup:* Based on your layout analysis, add organizing markup around your content markup in order to ensure that you have rows and columns all accounted for. Be sure not to add any markup unless its needed (keeping in mind that a column or row that is already represented by a single HTML element does not need a new organizer around it).

Use the Snapshot option to create a snapshot of your code to this point and be sure to enter the text, `MP1-B` somewhere in your snapshot message.

### Deliverable C: Content Styles

Continue your build out of your design by adding styles to just the content elements on your page. You should have at least 7 different styles to account for from your comp including the following:

* normal paragraphs
* normal list items (bulleted or ordered)
* primary heading
* secondary headings
* tagline
* lead paragraph
* action links

Place your styles in styles.css and be sure you're linking this into index.html. 

Be sure that you're also linking to any custom fonts in a valid way from within styles.css, such as by implementing the Google Fonts API. Also keep your selectors simple, being only as specific as necessary.

ZIP your entire current MP1 folder (so I can compare your content styles with your comp) and submit it in the provided space in Moodle.

### Deliverable D: Layout Build

Carrying forward with your build out, now add row and column settings in order to recreate the layout you've designed. Use your layout analysis from earlier as a guide and refer to the provided layout patterns for assistance. Build each responsive stop from mobile up to large desktop using progressively larger media queries and the min-width filter. Your stops should be (default styles are for mobile) 768px (for tablet), 1200px (for small desktop), and 1990px (for large desktop).

ZIP your entire current MP1 folder (so I can compare your layout reconstruction settings with your comp) and submit it in the provided space in Moodle.

### Final Submission

Make any final adjustments needed in order to polish your reconstruction. 

ZIP your entire current MP1 folder (so I can compare your final results with your comp) and submit it in the provided space in Moodle.
