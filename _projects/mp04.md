### Overview

In this project you will use WordPress to create a small informational site such as for a small business, corporation, or individual.

* You may redesign an existing site if you so choose. You may also create a site, but be wary of the load you take on in developing content for a new site.
* Steer away from an actual client due to the timeline and other restrictions.
* Do not choose a site with e-commerce as this will be the focus in the next project; stick to an informational site such as a corporate site, church or small business informational site, or special interest site.
* Include at least 4 pages of content including at least two layouts: Home page and Content page. Other layouts are welcome but not required. More pages are also welcomed by not required. 
* Ensure that the site is responsive with as many stops as necessary to ensure an intentional feel from desktop (maximum of 1440px) down to smartphone (minimum of 320px).

### Deliverable A: Wireframe prototype and Style Tiles

Use Sketch to quickly assemble a loose, grey-box prototype of your website. Use actual content where possible. 

Synchronize with an InVision project and ensure the professor is a collaborator in the project.

### Deliverable B: Design Comps and WordPress Setup
